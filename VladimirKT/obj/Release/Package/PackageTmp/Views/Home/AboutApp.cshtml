		<h4>Portfolio application</h4>
		<p>This is my portfolio application build in ASP.NET MVC</p>
		<p>.NET provides a lot of possibilities for making a good functional application.</p>
		<p>Certainly in making the first part of the application I did not have the need to take advantage of these possibilities</p>
		<p>I did not use the default in this section, so still needs to implement responsive design.</p>
		<p>Since the entire application was made to present me as a web developer</p>
		<p>The other part of the application I made to use developer skills I learned working with my friends in the company.</p>
		<p>Authentication, Authorize (Roles), Edit, Delete, Get, Post data to DataBase I promote in part @Html.ActionLink("MoviStore aplication", "MovieIndex", "Movie")</p>
